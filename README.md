Hi, my name is **Sara**, I am a passionate software developer who loves creating web applications for all users.
I am a very curious person who always enjoys learning new things.
What I love the most about software engineering is that it allows me to express both my **analytical skills** and my **creativity**.

Here are my most recent projects:
- Quiz & Learn App
- To Do App
